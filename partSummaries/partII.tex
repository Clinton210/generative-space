\part*{Summary of Part II: Hybridity and Internal Dynamics}

Part~II develops the principal internal behaviors supported by collapse fibers.  
Hybrid generative identities, introduced in Chapter~4, are those in which the mixer selects the digit layer with positive density.  
Hybrids are topologically dense in the full generative space and algorithmically universal in the effective core: every computable real number admits an effective hybrid generator.  
These identities illustrate how classical magnitude can arise from mechanisms in which both digit and meta layers play persistent roles.

Chapter~5 introduces ghost identities, in which the digit density is zero.  
Ghosts collapse to classical real numbers using rare digit events while the meta layer dominates the canonical output.  
Their sparse structure contrasts sharply with the hybrid regime and demonstrates the range of internal geometries consistent with a fixed magnitude.

Together, hybrids and ghosts show that collapse fibers contain diverse generative patterns.  
These patterns form the basis for the secondary coordinate systems and structural limitations analyzed in Part~III.
