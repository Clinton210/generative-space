\chapter*{Part IV Summary}

Part IV establishes the central incompleteness phenomenon of the Generative
Identity Framework.  
Although the collapse map determines the classical real number associated with
a generative identity, it discards most of the symbolic structure carried by
the selector, digit, and meta streams.  
This part shows that no finite collection of continuous observers can recover
that structure.

The first chapter develops the alignment and sewing tools that operate inside
collapse fibers.  
Identities in the same fiber expose the same digits in the same order, even
when their selector positions differ.  
This permits alignment of selected digits and controlled replacement of the
tail of one identity by the tail of another without changing the collapsed
value.  
These symbolic operations make it possible to preserve observer agreement on
finite prefixes while introducing divergence in unobserved tails.

The second chapter constructs the meta diagonalizer.  
Given an enumeration of all computable structural projections, the
construction produces a computable identity that agrees with a reference
identity on all observed prefixes but diverges from it along each projection
at a scale that eventually exceeds the tolerance assigned to that projection.
The diagonalizer is built inductively, using dependency bounds to satisfy
observer constraints at each stage and using tail sewing to introduce the
desired divergence.

The final chapter of the part proves the Structural Incompleteness Theorem.
For any computable real number $x$ and any finite family of computable
observers, there exist distinct identities in the collapse fiber
$\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{eff}}(x)$ that agree on the values of all observers in
the family.  
Finite observation cannot recover the generative identity.  
This establishes an inherent limit on what any finite analytical process can
detect about the internal structure of generative representations.

Part IV therefore demonstrates that generative structure is fundamentally
incomplete with respect to finite continuous observation.  
This incompleteness is not a consequence of randomness or approximation, but
arises from the topology and symbolic architecture of the generative space.
