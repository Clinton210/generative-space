\part*{Summary of Part IV: Structural Incompleteness}

Part~IV develops the central impossibility results of the generative framework.  
Chapter~8 constructs the meta diagonalizer, an effective generative identity that evades any finite family of secondary projections.  
The construction relies on the finite-prefix dependency bounds established in Part~III.  
By matching a reference identity on all inspected positions and modifying only the tail, the diagonalizer forces disagreement with every projection in the family.

Chapter~9 uses this construction to prove the Structural Incompleteness Theorem.  
The theorem states that no finite family of computable secondary projections can classify the effective fiber of a computable real number or distinguish all effective generative identities.  
Collapse preserves only classical magnitude, and all other observations are inherently limited by finite-prefix dependency.  
This impossibility result shows that internal generative structure cannot be recovered from any finite coordinate system.

Together, these chapters establish structural incompleteness as a fundamental property of the generative space and highlight the significant information loss induced by collapse.
