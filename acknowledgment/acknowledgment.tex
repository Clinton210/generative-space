The ideas developed in this monograph originated independently, long before I
had the formal mathematical background needed to express them precisely. My
graduate training is in Industrial--Organizational Psychology, and I am
currently completing an undergraduate degree in mathematics. The earliest forms
of the concepts that eventually became generative space---including the
interaction between structured and stochastic regimes in digit expansions,
mixing schedules, and the separation of mechanism from observable value---arose
from sustained attempts to understand how symbolic sequences can exhibit both
order and randomness. These intuitions gradually evolved into the program-based
architecture formalized here.

In preparing this manuscript, I made extensive use of contemporary AI systems.
Their role was primarily computational and expository: assisting in drafting,
restructuring, and exploring mathematical formulations. AI tools helped convert
my informal ideas, diagrams, and fragments of proof sketches into precise
