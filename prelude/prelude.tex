The ideas developed in this monograph grew out of long periods of independent study and reflection that predate my formal training in mathematics.  
My academic background is in Industrial and Organizational Psychology, and I am completing an undergraduate degree in mathematics.  
The earliest versions of the concepts that eventually became the generative framework arose from efforts to understand how symbolic sequences can combine ordered and stochastic behavior.  
These intuitions matured into the program-based architecture presented here.

I made extensive use of contemporary AI systems during the preparation of this manuscript.  
These systems assisted with drafting, restructuring, and checking the exposition, and they helped convert informal ideas and partial sketches into precise mathematical statements.  
All conceptual advances, definitions, and theorems in this work originate with the author, and the responsibility for correctness lies entirely with me.

I am grateful to my family and friends for their patience, encouragement, and support during the development of this project.  
Their confidence made this work possible.
