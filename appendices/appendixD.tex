\chapter{Technical Construction of the Meta-Diagonalizer}

\section{Introduction}

Chapter~9 presents the meta-diagonalizer, a mechanism that produces an effective
generator $G^*$ within a collapse fiber such that every projection in a given
finite family evaluates $G^*$ exactly as it evaluates a reference generator $H$,
while $G^*$ differs from $H$ in controlled and detectable ways outside the
observational horizon of those projections.

This appendix provides the full technical details of the construction:
\begin{itemize}
    \item defining sewing intervals,
    \item synchronizing digit-selection indices,
    \item maintaining fiber membership,
    \item ensuring projection-level indistinguishability at fixed precision,
    \item enforcing structural divergence beyond all finite dependency bounds.
\end{itemize}

\section{Setup and Notation}

Let $\mathcal{P} = \{\Phi_1,\ldots,\Phi_r\}$ be a finite family of computable
structural projections.  
Let $H=(M_H,D_H,K_H)\in\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{eff}}(x)$ be an effective generator
with collapse value $x$.

The goal is to construct an effective $G^*=(M^*,D^*,K^*)$ such that:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\pi(G^*) = x$,
    \item $\Phi_i(G^*) = \Phi_i(H)$ for all $\Phi_i\in\mathcal{P}$,
    \item $G^*$ differs from $H$ on infinitely many coordinates in each layer.
\end{enumerate}

Let $B_{\mathcal{P}}(2^{-k})$ denote the uniform dependency bound for precision
$2^{-k}$ (Appendix~C).

We define an increasing sequence of prefix lengths
\[
N_0 < N_1 < N_2 < \cdots
\]
with each $N_k$ chosen to exceed $B_{\mathcal{P}}(2^{-k})$, and we construct
$G^*$ in stages.

\section{Sewing Intervals and Construction Strategy}

The construction proceeds by alternating between:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{prefix alignment}, where $G^*$ agrees with $H$ on a long prefix
          to ensure all projections match at precision $2^{-k}$, and

    \item \textbf{tail divergence}, where we enforce differences between $G^*$
          and $H$ that lie beyond all current dependency bounds.
\end{itemize}

The key idea is:
\[
G^*|_{N_k} = H|_{N_k}
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\Phi_i(G^*)|_{2^{-k}} = \Phi_i(H)|_{2^{-k}}.
\]

Differences inserted beyond $N_k$ remain invisible at precision $2^{-k}$ to
every projection in $\mathcal{P}$.

\section{Stage Construction}

We define $G^*_k$ as the approximation to $G^*$ at stage $k$.  
Each stage consists of two sub-stages: alignment and divergence.

\subsection{Stage k: Alignment}

Choose $N_k > B_{\mathcal{P}}(2^{-k})$ and set
\[
G^*_k|_{N_k} = H|_{N_k}.
\]

By Lemma~C.\ref{lem:prefix-freezing},
\[
\Phi_i(G^*_k) \equiv \Phi_i(H)
\quad\text{to precision } 2^{-k},\ \forall\,\Phi_i\in\mathcal{P}.
\]

\subsection{Stage k: Divergence}

Beyond position $N_k$, modify each layer of $G^*$ as follows:

\paragraph{Selector Layer $M^*$:}

To ensure infinite divergence, insert a structured pattern (e.g., periodic
blocks increasing in length) beyond $N_k$, but maintain:
\begin{itemize}
    \item infinitely many digit selections,
    \item agreement with $M_H$ on the first $\ell_k$ selected positions,
          where $\ell_k$ exceeds the largest selection index used by any
          prefix-dependent computation of any $\Phi_i$ at stage $k$.
\end{itemize}

Thus $\pi(G^*)$ and $\pi(H)$ share the first $\ell_k$ digits, preserving collapse.

\paragraph{Digit Layer $D^*$:}

Modify $D$ in positions not selected within the first $\ell_k$ selected
indices.  
By Lemma~C.\ref{lem:digit-tail}, this does not change collapse.

\paragraph{Meta Layer $K^*$:}

Insert any effective divergent pattern beyond $N_k$.  
By Lemma~C.\ref{lem:meta-tail}, meta-layer changes do not affect collapse.

\subsection{Ensuring Effective Divergence}

At each stage $k$, force $G^*_{k+1}$ to disagree with $G^*_k$ on an infinite set
of coordinates beyond $N_k$.  
This ensures the limit object $G^*$ differs from $H$ on infinitely many
coordinates and is not equal to any of the stage approximations.

\section{Limit Construction}

Define $G^*$ by:
\[
G^*(n) = \lim_{k\to\infty} G^*_k(n).
\]

This limit exists because:

- for each coordinate $n$, $G^*_k(n)$ stabilizes once $k$ satisfies $N_k > n$,
- the construction ensures each coordinate is modified only finitely many times,
- the limit object is effective since the construction is computable uniformly.

\begin{proposition}[Correctness]
The limit object $G^*$ satisfies:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $G^*$ is effective,
    \item $\pi(G^*) = \pi(H)$,
    \item $\Phi_i(G^*) = \Phi_i(H)$ for all $\Phi_i\in\mathcal{P}$,
    \item $G^*$ diverges from $H$ on infinitely many coordinates.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
(1) Effectiveness follows because the construction is uniform and computable.

(2) By Lemma~C.\ref{lem:fiber-prefix}, each stage preserves fiber membership and the limit of fiber-preserving sequences remains in the fiber.

(3) At stage $k$, $\Phi_i(G^*_k)$ agrees with $\Phi_i(H)$ to precision $2^{-k}$.
Passing to the limit yields exact equality for all $i$.

(4) Each stage enforces divergence on a tail beyond $N_k$, and the $N_k$ increase,
so divergence occurs at new coordinates infinitely often.
\end{proof}

\section{Diagonalization Over Families of Projections}

To diagonalize over the entire finite family $\mathcal{P}$, the construction
ensures:

- alignment uses the uniform bound $B_{\mathcal{P}}$,  
- divergence is placed strictly beyond this prefix,  
- alignment intervals grow rapidly so no projection can stabilize on the tail,  
- divergence intervals force disagreement outside all dependency bounds.

Thus every projection in the family assigns the same value to $G^*$ as to $H$,
yet $G^*$ remains structurally distinct.

\section{Summary}

This appendix has provided:

\begin{itemize}
    \item the stagewise alignment–divergence construction,
    \item synchronization of selected positions for collapse preservation,
    \item prefix freezing via dependency bounds,
    \item combinatorial control of digit and meta modifications,
    \item the existence and correctness of the limit generator $G^*$.
\end{itemize}

These details complete the proof of the meta-diagonalizer and constitute the
technical foundation for the Structural Incompleteness Theorem.
