This monograph develops the generative framework for representing real numbers through layered mechanisms.  
The generative space $\mathcal{X}$ consists of mixer, digit, and meta sequences equipped with the product topology, and its effective core $\mathcal{G}_{\mathrm{eff}}$ consists of computable mechanisms.  
Classical magnitude arises from the collapse of a generative identity and serves as the primary invariant of the framework.  
Collapse maps $\mathcal{X}$ onto the continuum and maps $\mathcal{G}_{\mathrm{eff}}$ onto the computable real numbers, producing fibers that contain rich internal structure.  
Hybrid identities, which select digits with positive density, and ghost identities, which select digits with density zero, illustrate the variety of internal behaviors consistent with a fixed magnitude.  
Secondary projections provide coordinate systems for measuring aspects of this structure, but each depends on only a finite prefix of an effective identity.  
These finite dependence properties allow the construction of a meta diagonalizer that evades any finite family of computable projections.  
This yields the Structural Incompleteness Theorem, which shows that no finite coordinate system can classify effective generative identities.  
Classical analysis appears as a quotient of the generative space under collapse, with magnitude acting as a coarse invariant of a much richer internal mechanism.  
The final chapter outlines measure-theoretic, dynamical, and computability-theoretic directions for future research.
